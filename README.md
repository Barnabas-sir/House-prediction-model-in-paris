# Predictive Modeling: House Price Regression
This project builds and compares regression models to predict house prices using Python,
scikit-learn, and pandas. Three models were evaluated—Linear Regression, 
Decision Tree, and Random Forest—based on MSE, RMSE, and R² scores.
-  Linear Regression achieved the best performance with an R² of 1.000
-  Residuals were normally distributed, indicating minimal bias
-  Visuals include predicted vs actual plots and model comparison charts
